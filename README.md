# SDLC
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured approach to software development that outlines different phases to ensure high-quality software delivery. Here's an overview of the primary phases in the SDLC

1. Planning Phase

Objective: Define the project scope and feasibility.

Key Activities:
o Identify business needs and objectives.
o Conduct feasibility studies (technical, operational, financial).
o Draft a project plan, including timelines, resources, budget, and risk analysis.

Deliverables:
o Project Charter
o High-level requirements
o Initial risk assessment

Outcome: Clear roadmap and approval to proceed.
2. Analysis Phase

Objective: Understand and document user requirements in detail.

Key Activities:
TEST
o Gather functional and non-functional requirements through stakeholder interviews, surveys, or workshops.
o Analyze workflows, user interactions, and business processes.
o Create use cases, user stories, and process models.

 Deliverables:
o Requirement Specification Document (RSD)
o Feasibility and risk analysis reports

 Outcome: A comprehensive understanding of what the software must achieve.
3. Designing Phase

 Objective: Create detailed blueprints of the software.

 Key Activities:
o Develop system architecture and data flow diagrams (DFDs).
o Design user interfaces (UI/UX), databases, and APIs.
o Define technology stacks, tools, and integration points.
o Create prototypes and mockups.

 Deliverables:
o Software Design Document (SDD)
o Wireframes and prototypes
o Database schema

 Outcome: A clear and structured design ready for development.
4. Coding/Implementation Phase

 Objective: Write the actual code to build the software.

 Key Activities:
o Developers write, compile, and debug the code.
o Follow coding standards, naming conventions, and documentation practices.
o Perform unit testing for individual components.
TEST
o Use version control systems for collaboration.

 Deliverables:
o Source code
o Compiled and deployable builds

 Outcome: A functional software application.
5. Testing Phase

 Objective: Ensure the software meets quality standards and works as intended.

 Key Activities:
o Conduct different types of testing: unit, integration, system, acceptance, performance, security, etc.
o Log defects and perform regression testing.
o Validate functionality against requirements.

 Deliverables:
o Test Plan and Test Cases
o Defect reports
o Test summary report

 Outcome: A thoroughly tested and reliable application.
6. Installation/Deployment Phase

 Objective: Deliver the software to end-users and ensure a smooth transition.

 Key Activities:
o Deploy the software to the production environment.
o Set up user training sessions or provide manuals.
o Perform final checks (deployment verification testing).
o Ensure rollback plans are in place for emergencies.

 Deliverables:
o Deployed application
o Installation guides
TEST
o User manuals

 Outcome: Software is live and operational.
7. Maintenance Phase

 Objective: Provide ongoing support, updates, and improvements.

 Key Activities:
o Monitor system performance and fix issues.
o Address user feedback.
o Release patches for bugs or security vulnerabilities.
o Implement small enhancements as required.

 Deliverables:
o Updated software versions
o Performance and bug-fix logs

 Outcome: Software continues to operate effectively over time.
8. Retirement Phase

 Objective: Safely end the life of the software system.

 Key Activities:
o Decommission the software and notify stakeholders.
o Archive or migrate data as per legal or business requirements.
o Dispose of resources or repurpose infrastructure.
o Document lessons learned from the project.

 Deliverables:
o Archived data
o Final closure documentation

 Outcome: Formal closure of the project and resources are freed for new initiatives.
